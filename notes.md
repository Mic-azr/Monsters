Picking this back up to try and practice more API calling. Planning on changing the Werewolf constructor to check the phase of the moon on the current date, instead of checking if it is after midnight.
Will likely need to use java.net.http libraries, like in kata_wallet project
Should spend time reading documentation and example code before rushing into writing stuff

Seems like Werewolf has more room for improvement even beyond the moon phase change.
Missing a bit more than I remember here... wouldn't hurt to spend more time back on this project.
